        <p>Fuun: Bad luck, unlucky<br>Kichi: Fortunate </p><br>She was an accident. Her dad was the oyabun, the family boss of the Yakuza.
        However, her mom was some regular woman. The dad brought her on a "trip to the Bahamas" and kicked her off the plane. Physically. As it's moving.
        When she was free-falling, she gave birth and only the child survived. 
        She's extremely unlucky and accidents (not including unplanned children, that would be weird) follow her wherever she goes for some reason.

        <h5>Four-Leaf Clover</h5><img id="four" src='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10581533/10217454/c9987e00-67fd-11e5-99b6-68161a42f0bc.png' alt="Four-Leaf Clover" height = 200px, width = 200px;>
        <p>Four-Leaf Clovers are usually good luck, but in Japan, the kanji for shi (4) means death. Death will follow her around while she survives situations with her luck. <br><br>She was found by a scientist who raises her up with his girlfriend.
        He gave her a four-leaf clover necklace after learning that she survived the descent. The girlfriend eventually dies. Kichi spent so much time buying flowers that the next customer left in a fit of rage and ended up driving right into the girlfriend.
        <br>More symbolism! (Ended up with peace lily plant: symbolizes rebirth of reparted's soul) </p>

        <p>How does she get a stun-gun? She reunited with the Yakuza boss again who is on the verge of dying. Figures. She joins the mafia since she's
        next in line and the stun-gun prevents her from killing. She uses it everytime they take on jobs from the Yakuza. Japan also has an extremely strict gun-restriction.
        Even firing a gun lands you in prison for three years. <br>This gets the other members to rethink if they want her to be the future boss and plan assassination attempts.<br><br>

        <p>Butterflies were the first creatures we learned of that under go metamorphosis. The caterpillar undergo four stages of development
        to become a butterfly. <br><br> She'll have to deal with figuring out how to handle the mafia. She tries to persuade the Yakuza not to kill, deal drugs, etc.
        They can't handle it, then they disband. A new gang forms and wreaks more havoc than the previous Yakuza so she tries to get them back. She learns to fill in her father's shoes
        just to save Japan. Mostly everyone she knows will die so she'll undergo emotional stress. </p>
